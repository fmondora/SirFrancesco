# Sir Francesco

Sir Francesco is the first implementation of a Telegram bot designed to bridge the digital with the analog world. Created by Francesco, with a spirit of connection and giving, this platform allows family and friends to receive and offer actions that make a difference in the world.

While this bot is named after its first creator, Francesco, it is encouraged that when you deploy your version, you rename it appropriately to reflect the person or entity offering the favors. Personalizing the bot's name makes the experience more relatable and direct for those interacting with it.

## Purpose and Goals

This modest platform aims to:

- Foster actions in favor of individuals and communities with a direct and expressed commitment.
- Help recipients understand the spirit behind the offers made.
- Connect two or more people towards a common goal.

## Fortune Wheel Feature

### How Does It Work?

- Users initiate the fortune wheel by sending the `/fortunewheel` or `/fortune` command.
- Once the user spins the wheel, a random voucher from those available to the user is selected.
- Details of the selected voucher are then presented to the user, offering a unique and engaging experience.

This game adds an element of surprise and fun, engaging users interactively and providing them with the chance to discover new deals and rewards.

```
## Configuring Bot Commands via @BotFather

To enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to interact with Sir Francesco, you can configure the bot commands with descriptions and emojis. This provides a quick guide and visual cues for users when they start typing '/' in the chat. Here's how you can set them up via @BotFather:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Open @BotFather:** Start a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram.

2. **Select Your Bot:** Send the `/mybots` command, then select the bot you are configuring, which is Sir Francesco in this case.

3. **Go to Bot Settings:** Choose 'Bot Settings' from the options provided by @BotFather.

4. **Set Commands:** Select 'Edit Command' and enter the list of commands you want to set for your bot.

### Command List:

Copy and paste the following command list into the @BotFather chat when prompted:

''' 
start - üöÄ Embark on a journey with Sir Francesco!
fortune - üé° Spin the wheel of fortune!
info - ‚ÑπÔ∏è Curious about Sir Francesco?
'''

These commands and descriptions will now appear in the command list for users interacting with Sir Francesco. It's a great way to guide users and make the bot feel more friendly and accessible.

### Note:

- You can always modify, add, or delete commands later by revisiting the @BotFather and adjusting your bot's settings.
- Make sure the commands are up-to-date with the actual functionality of your bot to avoid any confusion for the users.
